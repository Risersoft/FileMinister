Conclusion:

Right now, make SEDMS_Serv.exe that runs as an application
Keep in mind that it might be converted to a service later (UI/Code separation)
Backer/mailer scheduler needs to be managed.

Handle.exe is for local files, and other Win32/.NET util functions also
for remote files, we need to use psfile/openfiles. going with psfile for now.

TODO:

1. frmPIDUnit for SEDMS, with PIDUnittype, handledby and WOAllowFolder selection
2. PIDUnitType Template Definition and creation of foldername according to that definition
3. Change of Server version to include activity catching and storage.
4. change of server version into service with task scheduler
5. FileStore Editing with permission checking
6. remove wdggroupnum,coregroupnum,tankgroupnum fields and storing group number general information in xml file.
